Hello! Here is a brief introduction about me.

### Work Experience

I am currently working as Principal Consultant at Aligned Automation, Pune, India.

Some of the projects I have worked on:
1. Prognostication of Li-ion Battery using physics informed data driven lifing models.
2. Use Data driven approach in simulations to make them faster and better.
3. State space based Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) end-to-end workflow for thermal characterization of 
   electronics systems. LTI, SVD, PCA, Krylov and response surface generation for surrogate models.


### Patents

1. Multi-chip module package compact thermal models ([us 10409358](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10409358))
2. Tile Level Reduced Order Model (ROM) for Smartphone Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) using Machine learning (Submitted)
3. Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) using Krylov Reduced Order Model (ROM) (Submitted)

### Skills

1. Machine Learning - Regression, classification, decision trees, ensemble learning, K-means, dimensionality reduction
2. Deep Learning - Deep Neural Networks, 
3. Physics Based Modelling
